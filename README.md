## Abot Me
I am Kahar Erbol. I have previously worked at Tash & Music Archive as a product manager, focusing on building databases and archives for music recordings. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work at Tesla as a Senior Product Specialist, where I was involved in the initial launch and sales of Model 3 in China. While balancing my responsibilities as a father, I am also a Software Engineer. I have a keen interest in creating innovative products and tackling complex problems using scalable approaches.
